# Python Variables
# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

# Example
# Variables in Python:

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.


# Comments
# Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

# Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

# Example
# Comments in Python:

# #This is a comment.
# print("Hello, World!")


# Comments can be used to explain Python code.

# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

# Creating a Comment
# Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# This is a comment
# print("Hello, World!")
# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

# Example
# print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
# A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

# Example
# #print("Hello, World!")
# print("Cheers, Mate!")


# Multiline Comments
# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

# Example
# #This is a comment
# #written in
# #more than just one line
# print("Hello, World!")
# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

# Example
# """
# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
# """
# print("Hello, World!")
# As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
